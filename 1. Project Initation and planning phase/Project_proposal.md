# Project Proposal â€“ Fraud Payment Detection

## Objective:
To build a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent payment transactions using various classifiers and deploy it through a user-friendly Flask web application.

## Problem Statement:
Online payment fraud is a growing concern. The aim of this project is to train a model on transactional data to accurately predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not.

## Goals:
- Explore and preprocess transactional data.
- Train multiple classifiers (RF, DT, XGBoost, etc.).
- Compare performance and select the best model.
- Build a web interface using Flask to deploy the model.

## Target Audience:
Financial institutions, e-commerce platforms, and fraud analysts.
